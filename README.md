# 🧠 AI Task Analyzer

A simple AI-powered task analyzer built using Python, NLP, and Jupyter Notebook.

This project processes natural task descriptions and intelligently predicts:
- ✅ *Priority level* (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- 💬 *Sentiment polarity* (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
- 📊 Provides *visual insights* using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- 🧠 Allows users to ask *natural language questions* about tasks

---

## 📁 Features

- Task sentiment analysis using TextBlob
- Rule-based & NLP-enhanced priority detection
- Smart query function using spaCy or keyword mapping
- Pie chart of task statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
- Bar chart showing task priority distribution
- Option to simulate random statuses for visualization

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- *Python*
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- textblob (for sentiment analysis)
- spaCy (for NLP understanding, optional)
- No frontend or backend — all logic is done in Jupyter
